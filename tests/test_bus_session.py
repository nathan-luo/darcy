# Note: Testing trace span creation and contextvars directly is complex.
# These tests focus on the functional correctness of handler routing,
# session scoping, and basic execution flow. The freezing issue might stem
# from deadlocks or unawaited tasks, which these tests aim to reveal through
# functional failures or hangs during test execution.
