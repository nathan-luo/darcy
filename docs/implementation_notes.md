# Implementation Notes

## Architecture Decisions

During the implementation of the LLMgine system, I focused on creating a clean, modular architecture based on event-driven design principles. Here are some key design decisions and thought processes:

### Message Bus as the Core Component

The message bus serves as the backbone of the system, allowing decoupled communication through commands and events. This design choice enables:

- Loose coupling between components
- Easy extensibility through new command/event handlers
- Natural fit for the asynchronous nature of LLM interactions
- Clear separation between requesting actions (commands) and reporting outcomes (events)

### Tool Management Design

I implemented the tool manager as a distinct component that:

- Automatically extracts function signatures to build OpenAI-compatible function descriptions
- Handles both synchronous and asynchronous tool functions
- Emits events for tool calls and results, enabling observability

### Mock LLM Implementation

For now, I'm using a mocked LLM implementation since we don't have actual API credentials. The mock follows these principles:

- Responds with canned replies based on keywords
- Simulates tool calling based on prompt content
- Maintains conversation history just like a real system would

### Observability Through Events

A key insight was making observability a first-class concept through event-based logging:

- Every significant action emits events
- The event logger captures all events with standardized metadata
- Events are saved both in memory and to disk in a structured format
- This approach enables easy integration with monitoring and analytics tools

### Circular Import Challenges

I encountered several circular import issues, especially between the UI and logging components. I resolved these by:

- Using local imports inside methods rather than at the module level
- Implementing type checking based on class names rather than direct isinstance checks
- Carefully organizing the module structure to minimize dependencies

### Command Registration Bootstrap Pattern

I've implemented a minimalist bootstrap pattern for command registration based on principles from the Cosmic Python book:

- **Pure Command Registration**: Bootstrap focuses solely on registering handlers with the message bus
- **Non-Invasive**: Engine implementations don't need to know about message bus registration
- **Configuration Objects**: Type-safe configuration through dataclasses
- **Engine Autonomy**: Each engine implementation contains its own internal managers and logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Bootstrap handles infrastructure wiring, engine handles domain logic

This pattern provides several benefits:
- Engines can focus on business logic without infrastructure concerns
- Clear separation between domain logic (engine) and infrastructure (message bus)
- Each engine defines its own specific implementation needs
- No artificial modularity or dependency injection where not needed
- Commands can be registered in one place outside engine implementation

### Future Improvements

Some areas I'd like to enhance in the future:

1. Implement real LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Add streaming support for responses
3. Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Create a more robust CLI with support for custom themes
5. Add more sophisticated context management for long conversations
6. Implement middleware for the message bus to add cross-cutting concerns
7. Add configuration providers (environment, files, etc.) to the bootstrap pattern

## Overall Architecture

The system is structured into these main modules:

- **bootstrap**: Application initialization and configuration framework
- **bus**: Core message bus implementation with command and event handling
- **llm**: Engine for interacting with language models
- **llm.tools**: Tool registration, description, and execution
- **ui**: User interfaces, currently focusing on CLI
- **observability**: Logging and monitoring tools

This structure enables clean separation of concerns while maintaining a cohesive overall system.

## Command Bootstrap Example

Here's a simplified example of using the Command bootstrap pattern:

```python
# Define configuration
@dataclass
class MyEngineConfig(ApplicationConfig):
    system_prompt: str = "You are a helpful assistant"

# Create your custom engine
class MyCustomEngine:
    def __init__(self, message_bus: MessageBus):
        # Message bus is the only external dependency
        self.message_bus = message_bus
        
        # Engine creates and manages its own internal components
        self.context = MyCustomContextManager()
        self.llm = MyCustomLLM()
        self.tools = MyToolManager()
        
        # Initialize tools, providers, etc. directly
        self.tools.register_tool(my_calculator_tool)
        self.llm.register_model("my-model", MyModelImplementation())
    
    async def handle_prompt(self, command: PromptCommand):
        # Engine implements command handling logic
        prompt = command.prompt
        conversation_id = command.conversation_id
        
        # Use internal components directly
        self.context.add_message(conversation_id, {"role": "user", "content": prompt})
        response = await self.llm.generate(prompt, self.context.get_history(conversation_id))
        self.context.add_message(conversation_id, {"role": "assistant", "content": response})
        
        return response

# Bootstrap just handles command registration
class MyEngineBootstrap(CommandBootstrap[MyEngineConfig]):
    def __init__(self, config: MyEngineConfig):
        # Create message bus
        self.message_bus = MessageBus()
        super().__init__(self.message_bus, config)
        
        # Create engine - it manages its own components
        self.engine = MyCustomEngine(self.message_bus)
    
    def _register_command_handlers(self):
        # Register engine's methods as command handlers
        self.register_command_handler(
            PromptCommand, self.engine.handle_prompt
        )
        self.register_command_handler(
            CustomCommand, self.engine.handle_custom_command
        )

# Usage
config = MyEngineConfig()
bootstrap = MyEngineBootstrap(config)
await bootstrap.bootstrap()

# Use the engine via the message bus
result = await bootstrap.message_bus.execute(
    PromptCommand("Hello, world!")
)
```

This pattern keeps engines focused on their core logic while the bootstrap simply connects command types to handler methods.
